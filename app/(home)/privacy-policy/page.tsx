            <p>
              In this policy, &quot;personal information&quot; or &quot;personal data&quot; means
              information about an identifiable individual that is subject to protection under the

              The Websites collect information through a variety of different ways and for different
              purposes as follows. If you choose to register with any of the Websites to receive

              our legitimate business interests to provide our services and/or to contact you about
